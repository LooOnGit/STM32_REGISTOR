# STM32 Register Programming

This repository contains code examples and projects for STM32 microcontroller programming using direct register access.

## Overview

This project focuses on low-level programming of STM32 microcontrollers by directly manipulating hardware registers. This approach provides:
- Better understanding of microcontroller architecture
- Maximum control over hardware resources
- Optimal performance for specific applications

## Project Structure

- `src/`: Source code files
- `inc/`: Header files
- `docs/`: Documentation

## Getting Started

1. Clone this repository
2. Set up your STM32 development environment
3. Build and flash the code to your STM32 board

## Requirements

- STM32 Development Board
- ST-Link programmer/debugger
- Development IDE (STM32CubeIDE, Keil, etc.)
